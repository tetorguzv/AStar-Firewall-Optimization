# A* Firewall Optimization

## Overview
This project utilizes the A* pathfinding algorithm to optimize firewall rule processing. By treating firewall rules as nodes in a graph, A* finds the most efficient sequence to process incoming packets, improving network speed and security.

## Features
- Implements A* algorithm for firewall rule sequencing
- Reduces redundant or inefficient rule processing
- Uses heuristics to prioritize security and performance
- Optimized for large-scale rule sets

## How It Works
- Each firewall rule is represented as a node in a graph.
- A* searches for the optimal path from the start rule to the goal (ALLOW destination).
- The heuristic function helps prioritize promising paths while ignoring inefficient ones.
- The algorithm efficiently selects rules that balance security and network performance.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Worst case:** \(O((n + e) \log n)\)
- **Optimized case:** Heuristic reduces search space, improving efficiency over uniform-cost search.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Priority Queue for A* implementation

## Usage
1. Define firewall rules in a structured format.
2. Run the A* optimization script.
3. Output provides the best rule sequence for efficient packet filtering.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with real-world firewall systems
- Advanced heuristics for dynamic network conditions
- Performance benchmarking on large rule sets
