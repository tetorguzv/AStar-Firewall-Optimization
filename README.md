# AStar-Firewall-Optimization
This project implements the A* (A-Star) algorithm to optimize firewall rule processing. By finding the most efficient sequence of rules for packet filtering, this approach enhances network security and performance. The heuristic-driven search prioritizes paths that minimize rule complexity while maintaining security constraints.
